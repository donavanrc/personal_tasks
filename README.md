# Personal Tasks

The Personal Tasks project was conceived as a practical exercise in developing an application, using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language.

This initiative consists of a brief list of personal tasks, plus an interesting gamification element. Users have the opportunity to advance in level by completing a certain task, making the experience more engaging. The difficulty of each task is indicated by a system of up to 5 stars, where 1 star indicates an easy task and 5 stars indicates a challenging task. The degree of difficulty directly influences the number of levels needed to reach the limit of a specific task, visible through a progress bar that follows the process of each task.

The application supports a complete CRUD, that is, it allows the creation, viewing, updating and deleting of tasks. Data is stored in an SQLite database.
