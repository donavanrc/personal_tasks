# Personal Tasks

The Personal Tasks project was conceived as a practical exercise for the application of fundamental concepts in application development, using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language.

This initiative consists of a brief list of personal tasks, plus an interesting gamification element. Users have the opportunity to advance in level by completing a certain task, making the experience more engaging. The difficulty of each task is indicated by a system of up to 5 stars, where 1 star denotes an easy task, and 5 stars signals a challenging task. The degree of difficulty directly influences the number of levels needed to reach the limit of a specific task, visible through a progress bar that accompanies the process of each task.
